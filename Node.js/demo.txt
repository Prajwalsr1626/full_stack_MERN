Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that is built on top of Google's V8 engine. 
One of the key features of Node.js is its event-driven architecture, 
which allows developers to write non-blocking, asynchronous code that can
handle a large number of concurrent connections.
In event-driven programming, the program flow is determined by events that occur in the system. 
Events can be anything from a user clicking a button to a network request completing.
When an event occurs, Node.js notifies the relevant event handler function and executes it to handle the event. This allows the program to continue running while waiting for potentially time-consuming operations, like file I/O or network requests, to complete.
Here is an example of event-driven programming in Node.js:
